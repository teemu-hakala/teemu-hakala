## Hello, w || ld!

### Today++;
- After a year of **Hive Helsinki** studies my skill palette contains high amounts of **C** authored in **Visual Studio Code** and compiled in **clang** with **GNU Make**.
<details>
<summary>What is Hive Helsinki all about? (Click for details)</summary>

- Project-based curriculum is  
  - split into branches of expertise (I chose graphics with raytracing)   
- Peer-to-peer learning instead of lectures:  
  - teach and get taught right when you need it the most  
- Learning to write clean code in the C language, which provides the  
  - readiness to quickly advance in higher-level languages  
  - understanding of working close to the raw memory  
- Growing ready for the working life with  
  - Top notch soft skills  
    - Solution-oriented co-operation at Hive makes you a strong team player  
  - Constant reflection of your coding skills in peer evaluations  
  - Self-paced schedule  
    - Provides the invaluable skill of personal agenda management  
- Strict criterion of passing your projects:  
  - The coding style: Norme via norminette  
    - [Norme](./en.norm.pdf)
    - [42School/norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette)
  - Each project subject outlines the task-specific requirements and possible bonuses  
    - [Hive Curriculum subjects until February 2023](https://github.com/teemu-hakala/42-Hive-Helsinki-2019-Curriculum)
- The healthy competetive spirit  
  - allows you to lift your peers to higher levels of knowledge  
  - leads into constant improvement  
- Being an active member of the Hive community:  
  - The whole is more than the sum of its parts  

</details>

### Future Goals;
- Raytracer written in C as the final project for Hive Helsinki.  
- Definitely more **C**; along with **C++**; **Python**; and **Rust**;  

### Highlights;
- **Hive Arena** Game Intelligence competition.  
- **BioCareerman II**, a Hive Game Jam masterpiece in a team of four students. Written in Rust as a first-in-series sequel.
